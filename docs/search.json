    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs new students in NYC, we are constantly exposed to crime-related updates through Clery Crime Alerts from Columbia University, which emphasize the importance of staying informed about local safety concerns. Additionally, Columbia’s initiatives, such as self-defense classes and situational awareness events, highlight the need to understand crime dynamics in our community. Beyond personal safety, this topic provides us an opportunity to examine broader societal concerns, including the effectiveness of public safety policies and the equity of law enforcement. This motivated us to explore NYC’s arrest data to gain deeper insights about the trend and distributions across the city.\nOur primary focus is to analyze and highlight the crime frequency distribution across precincts in NYC from January to September 2024, as understanding these geographical patterns is crucial for identifying areas with higher or lower crime rates. Additionally, we aim to uncover temporal trends in arrests, such as fluctuations by month or time of day, to better understand when crimes are more likely to occur. Furthermore, we seek to identify the most prevalent types of crimes and examine how these vary across demographic groups, including age, sex, and race, to provide a comprehensive view of NYC’s crime dynamics.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data source for this project is the “NYPD Arrest Data (Year to Date)” dataset, available through NYC OpenData. This data is collected by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and is reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning. Each record represents an arrest made in NYC by the NYPD, including details such as the type of crime, location, time of enforcement, and perpetrator’s demographics.\nThe data is in tabular format, consisting of 19 columns and approximately 195,000 rows, and is manually updated every quarter, with the data format including both numerical and text categorical fields. The available attachment, “NYPD_Arrest_YTD_DataDictionary.xlsx,” contains a detailed description of each variable.\nHowever, the dataset has several potential issues, including inconsistencies or delays due to manual updates, and outdated entries because of the quarterly update frequency. Null values are frequently present in certain fields, as some specific data were not collected or were unknown at the time of the report. Additionally, geo-location inaccuracies may affect spatial analysis since some arrests are represented by approximate coordinates.\nThe dataset is available in CSV format on the NYC OpenData portal, which can be directly exported, downloaded locally, and imported into RStudio using the read.csv() function.",

All other columns have no missing values. This discrepancy arises because certain data, like the arrest date, borough of arrest and perpetrator’s demographic information, are straightforward to record during the initial recording process. In contrast, classifying the level of offense and providing the description of internal classification often require more investigation or process.\nThe missing data in the dataset is negligible in the context of the overall dataset size, constituting less than 0.01%, indicating that the impact of missing data on analyses is minimal.\n\n\nCode\ndata_with_na &lt;- data |&gt;\n  filter(if_any(everything(), is.na))\nvis_miss(data_with_na) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of missing values across rows and columns\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Rows\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap reveals that missing values are concentrated in a few rows and specific columns, with no widespread gaps.

Therefore, these groups are excluded from the analysis to focus on the more predominant racial categories.\nThe demographic distribution chart offers a foundational understanding of the patterns observed in arrests. However, to delve deeper into the interplay between these demographic factors and their combined influence on arrest patterns, the alluvial flow chart offers a more dynamic and interconnected perspective. It allows us to visualize how different demographic categories, such as gender and race, flow into specific age groups, revealing hidden relationships within the data.\n\n\n3.1.2 Flow of Arrests by Demographics\n\n\nCode\nalluvia_data &lt;- na.omit(data) |&gt; \n  filter(!(PERP_RACE %in% c(\"UNKNOWN\", \"AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE\"))) |&gt;\n  group_by(PERP_SEX, PERP_RACE, AGE_GROUP) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  rename(Sex = PERP_SEX, Race = PERP_RACE, AgeGroup = AGE_GROUP)\n\nggplot(alluvia_data, aes(axis1 = Sex, axis2 = Race, \n                         axis3 = AgeGroup, y = Count)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Race), width = 0.2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 0.2, fill = \"lightgrey\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), size = 2) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Sex\", \"Race\", \"AgeGroup\"), expand = c(0.1, 0.1)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type='qual') + \n  labs(title = \"Flow of Arrests by Demographics\",\n       x = \"Demographic Categories\",\n       y = \"Number of Arrests\", fill = \"Race\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Alluvia diagram clearly shows a dominant overrepresentation of Black and white hispanic males, especially in the 25-44 age group, in arrest data. This trend, combined with the overwhelmingly higher number of male arrests across all races, suggests that certain demographics are being disproportionately affected. In contrast, smaller flows from groups like Asian/Pacific Islanders stand out, emphasizing how arrests are concentrated among specific racial and gender groups. These patterns raise important questions about potential systemic issues or societal factors that may be driving these disparities.\nOne significant influence on this disparities may be the areas where individuals reside, as different boroughs often reflect varying living standards, access to resources, and community dynamics. To explore this further, the following section will delve into the arrest distribution across different boroughs, investigating on how geography might play a role in these demographic trends.\n\n\n3.1.3 Mosaic Plot: Borough, Race, and Offense Level\n\n\nCode\nmosaic_data &lt;- data |&gt; filter(!is.na(LAW_CAT_CD)) |&gt; \n  filter(!(PERP_RACE %in% c(\"UNKNOWN\", \"AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(LAW_CAT_CD = factor(LAW_CAT_CD, levels = c(\"Violation\", \"Misdemeanor\", \"Felony\")))\n\nfill_colors &lt;- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(3, \"Blues\")\nmosaic(LAW_CAT_CD ~ ARREST_BORO + PERP_RACE, data = mosaic_data,\n       labeling_args = list(\n         set_varnames = c(\n           ARREST_BORO = \"Borough\", \n           PERP_RACE = \"Race\", \n           LAW_CAT_CD = \"Offense Level\"\n         ),\n         rot_labels = c(0, 0, 90), \n         gp_labels = list(LAW_CAT_CD = gpar(fontsize = 7),\n                          PERP_RACE = gpar(fontsize = 7))),\n       direction = c(\"v\",\"h\",\"h\"),\n       highlighting_fill = fill_colors,\n       main = \"Mosaic Plot: Borough, Race, and Offense Level\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mosaic plot reveals that while offense levels show consistent patterns across all boroughs - approximately half of the arrests are for felonies, nearly half are for misdemeanors, and violations constitute only a small proportion - there are striking disparities in the racial composition of arrests across boroughs, highlighting that borough is statistically significant to race. For instance, Black individuals dominate arrests in the Brooklyn, with proportions notably higher than in other boroughs, indicating a geographic concentration of demographic composition. In contrast, White individuals are more frequently arrested in Staten Island compared to the others, highlighting localized variations in racial arrest patterns. Similarly, White Hispanic and Black Hispanic individuals exhibit different arrest distributions, with greater white Hispanic representation in Brooklyn and Queens, and greater black Hispanic in Bronx and Manhattan. These variations point to the conclusion that the borough of residence plays a significant role in shaping arrest patterns across racial groups.\nFor the next section, we aim to find out the overall geographical patterns.",

These areas may experience higher crime rates due to concentrated urban activity and demographic factors.\nManhattan follows with 46,226 arrests, heavily concentrated in its central and southern regions, including areas like Midtown and Downtown. The high urban density, commercial activity, and large influx of daily commuters likely contribute to this concentration. The Bronx, with 43,896 arrests, shows dense clusters in its central and southern areas, reflecting persistent socio-economic challenges and a relatively high population density.\nQueens accounts for 42,969 arrests, characterized by a more dispersed pattern with prominent clusters in neighborhoods like Jamaica and Flushing. The suburban nature of Queens contrasts with the dense urban dynamics of Manhattan and the Bronx. Staten Island, with only 8,341 arrests, has the lowest crime figures, reflecting its smaller population and suburban characteristics, with most arrests concentrated in the northern part of the borough.\nBuilding on the borough-level insights, the precinct-level analysis provides a finer-grained view of arrest distributions across New York City.\n\n\n3.2.2 Arrests by Police Precinct in NYC\n\n\nCode\nboroughs &lt;- read_sf(\"new-york-city-boroughs.geojson\")\nprecincts &lt;- read_sf(\"Police Precincts.geojson\")\nboroughs &lt;- st_make_valid(boroughs)\nprecincts &lt;- st_make_valid(precincts)\nboroughs &lt;- st_transform(boroughs, crs = st_crs(precincts))\nprecincts_with_boroughs &lt;- st_join(precincts, boroughs, join = st_intersects)\nprecincts_with_boroughs &lt;- precincts_with_boroughs |&gt;\n  select(precinct, name, geometry) |&gt;\n  rename(Borough = name)\n\nprecincts_with_boroughs &lt;- precincts_with_boroughs |&gt;\n  mutate(precinct = as.integer(precinct))\nprecinct_arrest_counts &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(ARREST_PRECINCT) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n())\nprecincts_with_boroughs &lt;- precincts_with_boroughs |&gt;\n  left_join(precinct_arrest_counts, by = c(\"precinct\" = \"ARREST_PRECINCT\"))\nprecincts_with_boroughs &lt;- precincts_with_boroughs |&gt;\n  mutate(tooltip = paste0(\n    \"&lt;strong&gt;Precinct: &lt;/strong&gt;\", precinct, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n    \"&lt;strong&gt;Borough: &lt;/strong&gt;\", Borough, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n    \"&lt;strong&gt;Number of Arrests: &lt;/strong&gt;\", Count\n  ))\n\npal &lt;- colorNumeric(\n  palette = \"Reds\", \n  domain = precincts_with_boroughs$Count\n)\nleaflet(precincts_with_boroughs) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"OpenStreetMap\") |&gt;\n  addPolygons(fillColor = ~pal(Count), weight = 1, opacity = 1, color = \"white\",\n              dashArray = \"3\", fillOpacity = 0.7, \n              highlight = highlightOptions(\n                weight = 5, color = \"#666\", dashArray = \"\", \n                fillOpacity = 0.7,bringToFront = TRUE),\n              label = ~paste0(\"Precinct: \", precinct, \"&lt;br&gt;\", \n                              \"Borough: \", Borough, \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                              \"Number of Arrests: \", Count)) |&gt;\n  leaflet::addLegend(pal = pal, values = precincts_with_boroughs$Count, opacity = 0.7,\n            title = \"Number of Arrests\", position = \"topright\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe precinct map highlights significant variation in arrest numbers within boroughs, revealing areas of concentrated activity.

There are no drastic upward or downward shifts that would indicate a significant change in arrest rates across months. This means that there is no seasonal patterns being observed, so arrests are not significantly influenced by changes in weather or seasonal events during this time period. Additionally, the number of arrests fluctuates significantly throughout the week, with regular peaks followed by dips. The highest arrest counts tend to occur early in the week, around Mondays or Tuesdays, and gradually decline toward the weekends. To better understand the factors driving these fluctuations, the next stage of the analysis will focus on examining arrests by specific weekdays. This deeper investigation will help uncover how arrest patterns vary across the week and provide insights into the underlying dynamics shaping these trends.\n\n\n3.3.2 Daily NYPD Arrests by Weekday\n\n\nCode\nweekday_summary &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(ARREST_DATE, Weekday) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")  \n\nggplot(weekday_summary, aes(x = ARREST_DATE, y = Count, \n                            group = Weekday, fill = Count)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8) +  \n  geom_line(size = 1, color = \"black\") +  \n  facet_grid(Weekday ~ ., scales = \"fixed\", switch = \"y\") +  \n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\", \n                      name = \"Arrest Count\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 month\", date_labels = \"%b\") +\n  labs(title = \"Daily NYPD Arrests by Weekday\",\n       x = \"Date\", y = \"Number of Arrests\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), \n        strip.text.y.left = element_text(angle = 0),      \n        strip.placement = \"outside\", legend.position = \"right\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph visualizes daily NYPD arrests by weekday over a nine-month period, with each weekday represented by a separate facet. The color gradient, ranging from light blue to dark blue, reflects the arrest counts for each day, providing an additional layer of information to highlight fluctuations. While the Y-axis shows the count of arrests, the fluctuations within each line can be subtle, especially since the scale is fixed across all weekdays. Including the color gradient helps emphasize variations in arrest counts more clearly, even for weekdays with smaller changes. The patterns reveal that weekdays like Tuesday and Wednesday have consistently higher arrest counts, while weekends, particularly Saturday and Sunday, show significantly lower counts. This supports the observation of a strong weekly cycle in arrest activity, with midweek peaks and weekend lulls.\nBuilding on the weekday-specific arrest patterns, it is essential to understand how arrests vary across NYC boroughs over time.\n\n\n3.3.3 Daily NYPD Arrests by Borough\n\n\nCode\ndaily_summary_by_borough &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(ARREST_DATE, ARREST_BORO) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ndaily_arrest_data &lt;- daily_summary_by_borough |&gt;\n  select(ARREST_DATE, ARREST_BORO, Count) |&gt;\n  rename(date = ARREST_DATE, borough = ARREST_BORO, count = Count)\nwrite_json(daily_arrest_data, \"daily_arrest_data.json\", pretty = TRUE)\n\nggplot(daily_summary_by_borough, aes(x = ARREST_DATE, y = Count, color = ARREST_BORO)) +\n  geom_line(size = 0.8, alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily NYPD Arrests by Borough\",\n    subtitle = \"From January 1st to September 30th\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Arrests\",\n    color = \"Borough\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"2 week\", date_labels = \"%b %d\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart highlights how arrest counts fluctuate over time across the five NYC boroughs. Staten Island consistently exhibits the lowest arrest counts, with a relatively stable pattern that never exceeds 100 arrests per day. In contrast, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens display overlapping trends with higher daily counts, making it challenging to differentiate between these boroughs. Therefore, it is necessary to create a boxplot to better capture and compare the overall distribution and variation of daily arrest counts across the five boroughs.\n\n\n3.3.4 Weekly NYPD Arrests by Borough\n\n\nCode\nweekly_summary_boxplot &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(Week = floor_date(ARREST_DATE, unit = \"week\")) |&gt;  \n  group_by(Week, ARREST_BORO) |&gt;                           \n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt; \n  filter(Week &lt; max(Week))\n\nggplot(daily_summary_by_borough, aes(x = reorder(ARREST_BORO, -Count, FUN = median), \n                                     y = Count, fill = ARREST_BORO)) +\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = 16, alpha = 0.7, outlier.size = 2) + \n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Daily NYPD Arrests by Borough\",\n       subtitle = \"From January 1st to September 30th\",\n       x = \"Borough\", y = \"Number of Daily Arrests\", fill = \"Borough\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrooklyn stands out with the highest median daily arrests and a wider interquartile range, indicating more variability in arrest counts compared to other boroughs. This aligns with its larger population and higher levels of urban activity. Manhattan follows with a slightly lower median but still maintains a wide IQR, indicating variability likely influenced by high urban density and commercial activity. The Bronx and Queens display similar medians, though the Bronx exhibits a slightly narrower IQR, suggesting more consistency in daily arrest figures. Staten Island, on the other hand, shows significantly lower arrests with a tight interquartile range, highlighting its smaller population and suburban characteristics.",
